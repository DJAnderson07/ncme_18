# NCME 2018
This repo was created primarily in an effort to be as transparent as possible. I'll be committing to the repo as I work on the paper and, eventually, the slides.

If you're interested in my paper, or reproducing any of the results with the publicly available data (i.e., the interactive maps of Alameda County or Multnomah County displaying school achievement gaps with Census data), the file you probably want is Anderson_ncme18.Rmd, which contains both the text to produce the paper and the code to produce all the tables and figures.
